Export observations from iNaturalist in CSV format
https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export

Fill in the form as follows:
Taxon: [unrestricted so that ferns, etc. are included]
User: chris_nelson
Basic: id, observed_on, quality_grade
Geo: place_guess, private_place_guess
Taxon: scientific_name, common_name, taxon_id
Taxon Extras:
  taxon_kingdom_name (for the top-level classification)
  taxon_phylum_name (to recognize vascular plants [Jepson's coverage])
  taxon_subphylum_name (to recognize flowering plants)
  taxon_family_name (to group flowers by family)
Observation Fields: none

If the private_place_guess is supplied, it is more precise and so is
used instead of the place_guess.  See parks_format.txt for how the
place (location) is interpreted.

Where the scientific name and common name are both given, they supply
a default mapping (in either direction) for any flower that only has
one name manually entered.  If the scientific name is known, but the
common name differs from what the txt files have, it is recorded as an
alternative common name.

The taxon_family_name is used to automatically assign a family to all
observed species so that I don't have to enter it manually.  See also
family names.txt.
