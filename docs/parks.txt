parks.yaml names the parks and describes their location.

Its format is:
(area):
- (park name), or
- {(canonical park name), (match pattern)}

For observations from iNaturalist, the location of the observation is
mapped to a park name.  If the location *starts* with a known park
name, the location is mapped to that park.  If the any part of the
location matches a match pattern, the location is mapped to the
corresponding park.

Only observations that map to a park in area "bay area" are counted.
Observations that map to other areas are discarded.  If an observation
uses an unrecognized park name, that park is assumed to be in the bay
area, but a warning is printed.
