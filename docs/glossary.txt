Glossary files are named *.txt in the glossary directory.

Like the other txt files, a glossary file is standard HTML with some
extra syntax for easy programming.  As usual, the program creates a
standard header and footer for each page and includes the HTML text
between them.

In addition to the standard HTML, the following text cases are handled
specially.  Each case must be on a line by itself.

Meta-data:

title:[name] specifies the HTML title and <h1> header for the glossary
page.

taxon:[name] specifies the taxon for which the glossary is applied
(and all of that taxon's descendents).  If the taxon isn't specified,
the glossary is applied to all pages.

When linking to a glossary word, the link is preferentially created to
the lowest-level glossary that applies, but all glossaries in the
taxonomic hierarchy are considered.

Word definitions:

{[primary],[additional],[...]} [definition]

This defines the primary word.  The primary word is the one that is
presented in the HTML, but all additional words also trigger links to
the primary word in the glossary.  Additional words typically include
plural or adjective forms of the primary word.  Links are only created
for whole-word matches, but phrases can also be used for a multi-word
match and link.  If multiple matches are possible (e.g. "bell-shaped"
or just "bell"), the longest match is made.

It's an abuse of HTML's dictionary capability, but word definitions
can be interleaved with other HTML features such as headings and
normal paragraph text.
