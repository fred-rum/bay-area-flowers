Pages are created for all txt files, as described in txt.txt.  Pages
are also created for all flowers that have photos in the photos
directory, as described in photos.txt.

Among other information, txt files can also specify one or more
children of the page.  A typical hierarchy has a family page with
genus children, where each genus has species children (and possibly
down to subspecies/varieties).  However more or fewer levels of
hierarchy can be specified as desired, including groupings that don't
correspond to scientific taxons.

If there is more than one bay-area species in a particular genus, a
page for the genus should be created.  Typically the genus page should
describe how to distinguish the local genus members, although this may
not be necessary if the differences are obvious.  The program will
print a warning if the genus page is missing, or if any described
species are missing from a genus page.

The result is a number of independent trees of pages.

If the root of any tree is below the family level and the family is
known, the program automatically creates a page for the family that
links to all appropriate subtrees.  Pages within each family are
ordered by number of observations (among all pages in that tree), from
most to least.

The page with "All flowers" lists all top-level trees (typically
families, whether manually or automatically generated), ordered again
by observation counts.  The hierarchy within each tree is also listed
in the order in which the children are listed on each page.
