The filename defines a default common name (if all lowercase) or
default scientific name (if any letter is uppercase).  My preference
for the filename is to use the common name if there is one and it is
unique in the bay area.  The filename also determines the filename
used for the corresponding HTML page.

The text in the file is standard HTML.  The program creates a standard
header and footer for each page and includes the HTML text between
them.  The standard header includes any photos associated (by name)
with the page, plus links to CalPhotos as specified in the text.

In addition to the standard HTML, the following text cases are handled
specially.  Each case must be on a line by itself unless otherwise
specified.

Info:

com:[name] specifies the common name for the flower.  My preference is
to use the common name as given by iNaturalist for my area, although
I'll sometimes alter it or (especially for an intermediate level of
hierarchy) make one up.

sci:[name] specifies the scientific name for the flower.  The name can
be elaborated or stripped, although elaborated is recommended.  For a
genus, the elaborated name is "(Genus) spp.".  For a subspecies or
variety, the elaborated name "(Genus) (species) ssp. (subspecies)" or
"(...) var. (...)".  If the scientific name is stripped of its
elaborations, "spp." is assumed for a single-word name and "ssp." is
assumed for a three-word name.  If the species name starts with an
'X', e.g. "Iris Xgermanica", the 'X' is stripped off and a cross is
displayed to mark it as a hybrid.

If the common name or scientific name is not explicitly specified, the
program will attempt to find one by searching through observations.csv
for the given name.

The canonical scientific name is the one used by iNaturalist, but
other sites may be out of date or have made a different choice.  In
that case, different scientic names can be specified for the various
sites where it differs from the iNaturalist name:

Page links:

==[name] creates a child relationship to the named page.  The
specified name can be the scientific name (elaborated or stripped) or
the common name (if there is exactly one match) of the child.  If the
name is in [com]:[sci] format, both names are used to find the
corresponding page, and the page is updated if it only has one of the
names.  A link to the child page is also created.  The link displays
the common name and scientific name of the page.  It also displays the
first image for the page (a jpg or a CalPhotos placeholder) or a blank
placeholder.  If the common name ends with ',[jpg_suffix]', this is
stripped from the link, but the specified jpg is used as the link
image instead of the default first image.

If there is additional text in the same paragraph (on lines following
the child declaration, not separated by a blank line), the link and
the additional text are formatted as a unit.  On a wide page, the
additional text appears next to the image and below the name; on a
narrow page, the additional text appears below the image and name.

The following info can be included as part of the key for a child.  If
it appears elsewhere in the txt file (not in the paragraph following a
child link), the info is applied to the page itself.

sci_j:[name] specifies the scientific name as listed in Jepson.
sci_f:[name] specifies the scientific name as listed in CalFlora.
sci_p:[name] specifies the scientific name as listed in CalPhotos.

Multiple names can be specified for CalPhotos, separated by |.  The
iNaturalist name is also automatically included in the CalPhotos
search.

If multiple sites use the same scientific name, they can be combined
into one declaration, e.g. "sci_jfp:[name]".

If the name is "n/a", it indicates that the taxon is not listed under
any name at a site.

color:[names] specifies the colors of the flower, separated by commas.
Supported colors are in the color_list variable.  Colors are expected
for all taxons with associated photos, and not for taxons without
photos.

https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/[...]
https://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/noccdetail.cgi[...]
These links associate an external photo with the page.  A placeholder
image is added to the list of images, along with a link to the
CalPhotos/CalFlora page.  If '[label]:' appears before the link, the
corresponding label is added to the placeholder.


{-[page]} creates a link to the page without creating a child
relationship.  The link is just the common and scientific names of the
child on one line, without any image.

Other formatting:

'[' and ']' (each on a line by itself) creates a light-bordered box
surrounding all text between the brackets.

Any number of periods starting a line creates an unnumbered list.  The
depth of the list is equal to the number of periods.

The following are replaced with better-looking unicode characters:
+-
--
<=
>=
<<
>>
'

Manual html links (<a href=...>) are updated to include
target="_blank" so that they open in a new tab/window.

My photos can be supplemented with links to calphotos, e.g.
https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0911+0197
If a link to calphotos occurs within a key, it is removed from the key
and instead added to the keyed taxon.

A calphotos link can also be of the form
[label]:https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=[...]
in order for the link to be given a descriptive text label.
The label may include spaces.

The completeness of the guide is indicated with x:[txt] or xx:[txt].
x: specifies the completeness of a genus, and xx: is for a species.
Each can also be used at a lower taxon level when there are no other
members of the genus/species.  For this reason, both x and xx can
potentially be used on the same page.

The following [txt] values can be usd for x: or xx:
none - taxon has no subspecies or variants
any - there are no other taxon members anywhere
ba - there are no other taxon members in California
ca - there are no other taxon members in California
hist - taxon members only in the historical record are ignored
rare - extremely rare taxon members are ignored
hist/rare - historical and extremely rare taxon members are ignored
more - there are additional taxon members that need to be documented
![txt] - the key to distinguish the taxon members is not complete

xx:uncat - species has subspecies or variants not yet categorized

If the completeness is left unspecified for a genus, it acts as
x:more.  If the completeness is left unspecified for a species, then
no completeness information is put on the species page.  (Completeness
of the members of a species is not a priority.)

Strategy:

It's often good to simply create a stub page for the genus, using its
common name from iNaturalist as the filename and also giving its
scientific name with sci:[name].  The created HTML page then has
convenient links for finding all bay area species known by CalFlora,
finding the key in Jepson, etc.
