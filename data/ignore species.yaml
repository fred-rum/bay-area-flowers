Castilleja densiflora densiflora: +distinguishing subspecies is ambiguous, so I won't try
Delphinium patens patens: +IDing species is already hard enough
Eschscholzia californica californica: +They're all ssp. californica, but since it doesn't have a common name and it confuses people on iNaturalist, I generally just leave it at the species level
Trillium ovatum ovatum: +They're all ssp. ovatum, but no one cares
