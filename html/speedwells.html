Its lower petal is generally smaller, and the white spot bleeds strongly onto it and somewhat onto the two adjacent petals.  The upper petal may have a purple margin between the white eye and the blue primary color.</span></div>

It also has a centra white spot, but the spot is more restricted to the inner bowl of the corolla.</span></div>

There are a few other, rarer speedwells.  Most are different colors and are thus not easily confused with the more common ones.
