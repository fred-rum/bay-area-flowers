Update txt format to be line based and require fewer braces.
  manually remove uses of '{child:[page]}' and '{[page]:[photo].jpg}'
    done
  detect any cases of more than one image in repl_photo_box()
    (multiple sets of braces in the imgs variable)
    manually remove those cases
  read bare CalPhotos links from txt file:
    include the image when writing the header images for the page
    restore secondary CalPhotos links for checkerblooms
  write jpg_list automatically without going through self.txt
  detect CalPhotos link followed by child link ({+...}):
    do this after detecting children so that the page is present
    add the CalPhotos link to the child page's txt prior to parsing it
  create photobox when linking:
    remove the CalPhotos link when it is recorded
    in repl_child, return only the link (no photo)
    create nested photobox and image link for a child link
      include the following text in the outer box
    use the child's CalPhotos photo when linking
  modify text prior to *all* parsing, then parse it accordingly:
    {sci:...} -> sci:... (put space after colon or not?)
    {com:...} -> com:...
    {ba|ca|...} -> x:...
    {[ -> [
    ]} -> ]
    {+link} or {link:link} -> +link or +link:link
    add color:... to txt, then parse it from the txt
    {-...-} -> start each line with a period
  ignore blank lines at the start of the file after parsing info
  write out modified txt files:
    write only files that match at least one:
      page was created from txt file (even if txt string is empty after parsing)
      has CalPhotos
      has a color
        (not sure that this is useful for unobserved flowers, but just in case)
        forces output for all observed flowers
          transfers scientific name from observations.csv to txt file
          but do I really want to manually write the family for everything, too?
            nah, but it's only necessary for genuses (at most),
              and I'm willing to rely on observations.csv for it.
    write to txt file:
      com and/or elab if not same as page name (or easily derived)
      color
      completion status
      CalPhotos
      blank line
      modified txt string:
        call parse_names(), _complete(), and _children(), but not _glossary()
        output prior to calling self.parse()
        in repl_child, return the original text
          (e.g. so it includes the scientific name)
          or add the scientific name to the link if it wasn't there before
    use new txt files in place of old txt files
    delete color.yaml and remove the correponding code
    remove parse_child_calphotos() and comment out rewrite()
