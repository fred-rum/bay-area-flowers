<h1 id="title">Firefox Browser Notes for Offline Usage</h1>
<p>The amount of offline storage needed for this guide is quite reasonable on modern devices, but it is still an intense experience for some browsers.  Hopefully these notes will prevent frustration on your end.</p>
<h3>Keeping the Download Alive</h3>
<p>Downloading files for offline use will continue in the background while you browse the guide (including this page).  However, <b>downloading is likely to pause</b> in any of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your device goes to sleep.  (You might need to occasionally touch your mobile screen if it would otherwise time out due to inactivity.)</li>
<li>You switch to your home screen or a different app.</li>
<li>You browse to a different site.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the downloading process is paused, just click the green button again to resume.</p>
<p>On a desktop, it should be sufficient to keep the Guide tab visible (not minimized), even if another window has focus.</p>
<h3>Storage Limits</h3>
<p>Firefox allows a web app to use up to 10% of the available free space on your device.  (Not 10% of the total space!)  If that is not enough, you might need to use another browser with a less restrictive limit.</p>
<p>Firefox on the desktop may ask whether to allow the Guide to store data in persistent storage.  If you respond with "Not now" or "Never", the offline files will still be recorded, but the browser may delete them later if space runs short.  If you respond with "Allow", all offline Guide files (including files downloaded previously) will be kept until you actively delete them.  Oddly, persistent files don&rsquo;t fully count toward quota usage.  The Guide therefore estimates the actual usage.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, <b>Firefox on mobile does not yet support persistent storage.</b></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read down this far, congratulations.  You might be the kind of person who runs their browser in Private Browsing mode.  Firefox doesn&rsquo;t allow any interaction with offline files while in Private Browsing mode.  You&rsquo;ll need to disable Private Browsing in order to download or use offline files.</p>
<h3>Save to your Home Screen</h3>
<p>You can save a link to the Guide on your home screen.  On Android, open the Firefox menu and select "Install."  Sometimes this doesn&rsquo;t actually put anything on your home screen.  If so, you can manually drag it from Android&rsquo;s installed apps to your home screen.</p>
<p>Firefox on iOS or the desktop doesn&rsquo;t offer an installation option.  Sorry.  As an alternative, you can bookmark the Guide for use in offline mode.</p>
<h3>Try it!</h3>
<p>Return to the <a href="index.html">Guide home</a> and give offline mode a try.  If it doesn&rsquo;t work, online browsing remains supported as always.</p>
