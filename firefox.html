<h1 id="title">Firefox Browser Notes for Offline Usage</h1>
<p>The amount of offline storage needed for this guide is quite reasonable on modern devices, but it is still an intense experience for most browsers.  Hopefully these notes will prevent frustration on your end.</p>
<h3>Keeping it Alive</h3>
<p>Saving offline files will continue in the background while you browse the guide (including this page).  However, <b>saving is likely to pause</b> in any of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your device goes to sleep.</li>
<li>You switch to your home screen or a different app.</li>
<li>You browse to a different site.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the saving process is paused, just click the green button again to resume.</p>
<p>On a desktop, it should be sufficient to keep the Guide tab visible (not minimized), even if another window has focus.</p>
<h3>Storage Limits</h3>
<p>Firefox allows a web app to use up to 10% of the available free space on your device.  (Not 10% of total space!)  If that is not enough, you might need to use another browser with a less restrictive limit.</p>
<p>If you've read down this far, congratulations.  You might be the kind of person who runs their browser in Private Browsing mode.  As usual, all of your data from Private Browsing will be deleted when you leave Firefox.  So you'll need to disable Private Browsing before saving the Guide's offline files.  And don't forget to disable Private Browsing when saving updates later.</p>
<h3>Save to your Home Screen</h3>
<p>You can save a link to the Guide on your home screen.  On Android, open the Firefox menu and select "Install."  Sometimes this doesn't actually put anything on your home screen.  If so, you can manually drag it from Android's installed apps to your home screen.</p>
<p>Firefox on iOS or the desktop doesn't offer an installation option.  Sorry.  As an alternative, you can bookmark the Guide for use in offline mode.</p>
<h3>Try it!</h3>
<p>Return to the <a href="index.html">Guide home</a> and give offline mode a try.  If it doesn't work, online browsing remains supported as always.</p>
