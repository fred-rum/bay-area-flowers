Make separate pages (and links) for flower lists (by color and "all")
with names only (for bandwidth saving) and photos only (for fast skimming).

Add links at the top of primary color pages to secondary color anchors.

Consistently display both the common name and scientific name on
container pages.

Allow genus names to be attached to container pages.
  e.g. sci.yaml associates common name to genus name.
  list scientific name as "{Genus} spp."
  include scientific name on list pages (or maybe it does already)
  link to iNaturalist using ?search_on=names&q={genus}
  link to CalFlora & Jepson eFlora the usual way
  don't link to CalPhotos because it doesn't work and wouldn't be useful
  include scientific name on backlink from children?
  if the scientific name is not specified, then
    disable the current behavior of including observation counts and
    external links at the bottom of the page.
  (and fix baby blue eyes container page)

if a grandparent links to a parent, and the parent doesn't have its own jpg,
   use its first child's jpg.  (I.e. when determining parent-child
   relationships, also update flower_jpg_list.)

it would be nice to attach colors to individual jpgs of a flower,
  e.g. for baby blue eyes (N. menziesii).

Enhance {child:...} links to automatically include the primary child
image when desired.  This either requires processing pages child pages
first or determining the primary image automatically from the filename
(e.g. by sorting).

Should child image links load the full-size photo or the child's page?
Probably the latter.  Which means that existing child images and links
must be updated.

Proposed:
  {+img:...} invokes only the selected image, linked to the child.
  {+name:...} invokes only the name, linked to the child.
  {+...} invokes both the primary image and the name, linked to the child.

It'd be nice to split the img and text onto separate lines on small
screens only, e.g. for ceanothus.
  e.g. create photo-box-split with @media condition:
    for small screens change "display: flex;" to "display: block;"
I'm not sure it's possible to leave the child name on the img line and
  drop out the remaining lines.  They're currently all in one span.
  Making it two spans puts them in separate columns.

Proposed:
  {-...}
