Make separate pages (and links) for flower lists (by color and "all")
with names only (for bandwidth saving) and photos only (for showing off).

It would be nice to have a glossary with popup links automatically created
  where glossary words are used.
Jepson example:
<u class="dotted" title="Group of bracts more or less held together as a unit, subtending a flower, fruit (acorn cup), or inflorescence.">Involucre</u>
Remember that mobile doesn't support hovering.

Print errors:
  *no color listed
  *listed color not supported
  *broken photo
  no scientific name for leaf page
  multiple scientific names from observations.csv

It'd be nice if the up/down arrow keys changed which autocomplete entry was currently selected.

It'd be nice if the escape key removed autocomplete until more was typed.

how to mass rename files:
for f in *.jpg; do git mv "$f" "$(echo $f | sed 's/-\([-0-9]*\)\.jpg$/,\1.jpg/')"; done

Create a script to help copy new and changed files to a portable device.
  Copy new and modified files to a new (and git-ignored) folder,
    ready for the user to copy them over using Windows Explorer.
  Record the timestamp of all files to a (git-ignored) database
    to be used next time for identifying new and modified files.
  Deleted files won't be deleted, but they won't cause any harm.
  Include top-level files that should be copied if they are modified,
    e.g. index.html, bafg.css, search.js, pages.js
  Perhaps allow an argument with a date so that all files modified
    after that date are copied in case the database gets screwed up.
  (Explorer displays the photo creation date, but the file modification
    data is still correct internally.)

Should autogenerated families be structured more like top-level lists
(with a complete indented hierarchy)?

Put month info in table format with bar chart.
Put month info side by side with park info (depending on display width?)

/cygdrive/c/Python27/python -m cProfile -s cumtime flowers.py  | less

Add (optional) color info for unobserved flowers?
How would that be presented?  (border on CalPhoto placeholder?)

Allow families to auto-list their members after some introductory
text.  E.g. most sedges have triangular stems and grasses have round stems.

Make links up to the key (or any other parent) use an anchor position
that highlights the child's section of the key, similar to the
glossary.  (May require similar positioning tricks.)

Have a way to link from txt to the key to a flower (e.g. for
rough-fruited buttercup in buttercups).
E.g. {-buttercups#rough-fruited buttercup}

If all modified pages are under a single modified parent (excluding
"all" and color lists), bring up that parent page automatically.  (Or
simply list it first, or list the modified pages hierarchically.
Might be able to reuse the html generation for color lists.)

Support color:none for non-flowering plants.  Allow it to be used at
an upper level of hierarchy, from where it automatically propagates
downward through the tree.  (Should I also allow propagation for other
colors?  It could come in handy, e.g. for a genus that is always the
same color.  But it would also make it easy to be sloppy and not
verify the correct color of everything.)

For HTML files, use the scientific name instead of the common name if
possible?  This reduces churn when common names change, but it makes
it harder to find the corresponding txt file.  In any case, common
names don't change often, and scientific names can change, too.

For a line that begins with '[', include an automatic h3 or lower
format on the remainder of the text line.  Use increasing header
numbers based on the bracket depth.  Line breaks remain <br/>.
Recognize this and continue the header, or require that the line be
run together with <br/> in the middle?

The banner is a single petal, but a crease along its midline may give
the appearance of two petals fused at the edge.


The main glossary should include manual links to lower-level
glossaries, and vice versa.

top view shows all the parts, but is too crowded to label


Allow a search for a glossary with no term (no anchor).

Clear autocomplete window after clicking an entry to follow a link.
Otherwise Android leaves the autocomplete window populated.
