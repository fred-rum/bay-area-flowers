Make separate pages (and links) for flower lists (by color and "all")
with names only (for bandwidth saving) and photos only (for showing off).

Print errors:
  *no color listed
  *listed color not supported
  *broken photo
  no scientific name for leaf page
  multiple scientific names from observations.csv

It'd be nice if the up/down arrow keys changed which autocomplete entry was currently selected.

It'd be nice if the escape key removed autocomplete (or the entire
search text) until more was typed.

It'd be nice if ctrl-enter opened a new tab, and shift-enter opened a
new window.

how to mass rename files:
for f in *.jpg; do git mv "$f" "$(echo $f | sed 's/-\([-0-9]*\)\.jpg$/,\1.jpg/')"; done

Create a script to help copy new and changed files to a portable device.
  Copy new and modified files to a new (and git-ignored) folder,
    ready for the user to copy them over using Windows Explorer.
  Record the timestamp of all files to a (git-ignored) database
    to be used next time for identifying new and modified files.
  Deleted files won't be deleted, but they won't cause any harm.
  Include top-level files that should be copied if they are modified,
    e.g. index.html, bafg.css, search.js, pages.js
  Perhaps allow an argument with a date so that all files modified
    after that date are copied in case the database gets screwed up.
  (Explorer displays the photo creation date, but the file modification
    data is still correct internally.)

Should autogenerated families be structured more like top-level lists
(with a complete indented hierarchy)?

Put month info in table format with bar chart.
Put month info side by side with park info (depending on display width?)

/cygdrive/c/Python37/python -m cProfile -s cumtime src/bawg.py | less

Add (optional) color info for unobserved flowers?
How would that be presented?  (border on CalPhoto placeholder?)

Allow families to auto-list their members after some introductory
text.  E.g. most sedges have triangular stems and grasses have round stems.

Make links up to the key (or any other parent) use an anchor position
that highlights the child's section of the key, similar to the
glossary.  (May require similar positioning tricks.)

Have a way to link from txt to the key to a flower (e.g. for
rough-fruited buttercup in buttercups).
E.g. {-buttercups#rough-fruited buttercup}

If all modified pages are under a single modified parent (excluding
"all" and color lists), bring up that parent page automatically.  (Or
simply list it first, or list the modified pages hierarchically.
Might be able to reuse the html generation for color lists.)

Support color:none for non-flowering plants.  Allow it to be used at
an upper level of hierarchy, from where it automatically propagates
downward through the tree.  (Should I also allow propagation for other
colors?  It could come in handy, e.g. for a genus that is always the
same color.  But it would also make it easy to be sloppy and not
verify the correct color of everything.)

For HTML files, use the scientific name instead of the common name if
possible?  This reduces churn when common names change, but it makes
it harder to find the corresponding txt file.  In any case, common
names don't change often, and scientific names can change, too.

For a line that begins with '[', include an automatic h3 or lower
format on the remainder of the text line.  Use increasing header
numbers based on the bracket depth.  Line breaks remain <br/>.
Recognize this and continue the header, or require that the line be
run together with <br/> in the middle?

Parts of a pea flower:

The banner is a single petal, but a crease along its midline may give
the appearance of two petals fused at the edge.

good side view down to bracts
top view shows all the parts, but is too crowded to label


Add search terms for 'Jepson eFlora glossary' and 'Jepson glossary'.
Note that these will need special handling to get the right link color
while not adding an anchor.  I.e. recognize a glossary without a coms
list while normalizing pages.js.

Add glossary entries to replace as many Jepson terms as I can.  If I
can get all of them, then perhaps I can make use of a Jepson term an
error.

Allow Jepson terms to appear in the searchable dictionary and perhaps
in glossaries, but not linking them in page text to avoid clutter.
E.g. hair.


Apply standard page substitutions on glossary pages, e.g. blank lines
to <p/>.

Add inflorescence shape definitions for sedges.  (Possibly share the
glossary with grasses, but probably not.)


Redo shrink() to instead allow testing two names against each other
while testing specific plural substitutions.  (But also keep the code
to throw out non-word characters from each.)  E.g.
is_same(name, 'z', 'zzes')

Should I detect when a term is only ever referenced via the glossary
of a lower-level taxon?  E.g. a flower term is accidentally included
in the plant glossary.  But I allow terms to simply not be used, so
why wouldn't I allow terms to be used in only a few places?

Detect when a glossary term is defined twice in the same file (or
definition) (e.g. a typo).

Allow iNaturalist taxon to be specified since iNaturalist fails for
shared genus names, e.g. onions (Allium).

Separate surprise_obs into multiple parts:
  species that don't have a page despite there being a genus page
    (or should it be all plant species that don't have a page?)
    (includes subspecies if the species page is missing.)
  subspecies that have a common name and a genus page (or are plants),
    but no page.
  subspecies that don't have a common name but are under a species
    for which subspecies are listed.

Support a command-line argument to increase the number of errors that
can be printed (or disable any limit).

Should top-level non-flowering-plant taxons be presented
hierarchically (similar to the glossary ToC)?  To what level?

Allow 'glossary' in the JavaScript search to match any glossary.  What
about subsets of glossary?  I feel like it should match exactly as if
the match pattern were against '[word] glossary', but then the
highlighting is only on '[word]' and 'glossary'.
