There are a crazy number of manzanita species in the bay area.  I will not try to differentiate them here until I have more identified observations.

Key features:
. burl at base of trunk (rare) or not
. leaf surfaces same adaxially and abaxially or (rarely) different in color and/or hairiness
. leaf shape
. leaf sticky or not
. shape of nascent inflorescence bracts
. inflorescence shape
. flower parts in 4s or 5s
. size and shape of fruit (spheric or depressed)

==big berry manzanita:A. glauca

==common manzanita:A. manzanita

==pallid manzanita:A. pallida
