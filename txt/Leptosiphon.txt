<b>Caution: IDs unsure</b>

There are quite a few Leptosiphon species in the bay area and my IDs thus far have not been good quality.  This page lists some key features, but I don't attempt to replicate the whole Jepson decision tree.  Instead, each flower description includes enough information to (hopefully) confirm an ID hypothesis (with help from CalPhots).

Key features:
{-
stem length and branching
leaf lobe length and shape
densely bracted head or not
corolla salverform or not
calyx & calyx membrane (in many cases this is embedded among the dense bracts at the base of the corolla tube)
corolla tube, throat, and lobe colors
stamens exserted or not
-}

{+variable linanthus}
{-
Stem: 4--40 cm, may be be branched at base or above
Leaf: lobes 2--18 mm, narrowly obovate to linear, tip of middle lobe acute
Inflorescence: densely bracted head
Calyx: 4--10 mm, <b>densely hairy, glandular</b>, membrane obscure
Corolla: salverform, tube 11--46 mm, thread-like, maroon, pink, or yellow, throat yellow, purple, or orange, <b>lobes 4--8 mm</b>, elliptic to oblanceolate, pink, white, yellow, or purple, often with red marks at lobe bases

-}

{+false babystars}
{-
Stem: 5--45 cm (unknown branching)
Leaf: lobes 6--30 mm, narrowly oblanceolate to linear
Inflorescence: densely bracted head
Calyx: 6--13 mm, [hairs sparse or 0 except on margins], <b>ciliate, nonglandular</b>, abaxially generally glabrous [huh?  is this the outside?], membrane much narrower than lobes
Corolla: salverform, tube 10--33 mm, thread-like, pink or lavender, throat generally violet at base, yellow above, <b>lobes generally > 8 mm</b>, oblanceolate to linear, often abruptly soft-pointed, lavender, white, or pink, bases yellow, occasionally with white distal to yellow
stamens exserted; stigma 2--6 mm
-}

{+serpentine leptosiphon}
{-
Stem: 10--20 mm, thread-like (unknown branching)

Calyx: 3--6 mm, generally hairy, membrane generally = calyx
Corolla: funnel-shaped, tube 3--6 mm, purple, with wide hairy ring inside near throat, throat 3 mm, generally maroon, lobes 4--6 mm, lanceolate, pink, bases yellow, occasionally with white distal to yellow
stamens attached above hairy ring, exserted; stigmas 1--2 mm
-}

{+large-flowered leptosiphon}
{-
Stem: branched above, hairy
