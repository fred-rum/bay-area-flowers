x:ba
color: yellow, orange

<b>Caution: ID unsure.</b>  CalFlora lists only one kind in the area, but I'm not entirely sure that this is it.

Key features to verify O. ficus-indica:
. "stem" velvety or minutely hairy or not, with bristles > 2 mm or inconspicuous
. terminal stem segment length
. fruit or flower color
. fruit spiny or not, juicy or not
. 1 erect trunk or several basal branches +- decumbent to ascending
. overall height
. number of areoles per ovary
.. ovary is the fist-sized protrusion that sprounts a flower
.. areoles are the spots where spines potentially sprout
