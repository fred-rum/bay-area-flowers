sci:Plagiobothrys spp.

There are dozens of popcorn flowers in the bay area, and Jepson's key often uses nutlet characters to distinguish them.  I'll definitely need the NRDB's help for identification, plus as many features as I can observe.

Key features:
. stem erect, decumbent, or prostrate
. lower cauline leaves alternate or opposite (upper cauline leaves may differ)
. basal leaves present, withered, or gone
. color of abaxial leaf midveins and margins, staining or not
. number and position of bracts
. inflorescence strongly coiled toward tip or not
. petal diameter*
. calyx length, hair color, base fleshy, lobe shape, lobes bent or straight [generally upward], lobe midvein stout or slender
. pedicel length, thick & hollow or slender and solid

(*) "Limb diameter" means the diameter of the roundish, spreading portion of an individual petal beyond the corolla throat.
