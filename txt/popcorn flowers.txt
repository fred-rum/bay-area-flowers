sci:Plagiobothrys spp.

There are dozens of popcorn flowers in the bay area, and Jepson's key often uses nutlet characters to distinguish them.  I'll definitely need the NRDB's help for identification, plus as many features as I can observe.

Key features:
. stem erect, decumbent, or prostrate
. lower cauline leaves alternate or opposite (upper cauline leaves may differ)
. basal leaves present, withered, or gone
. color of abaxial leaf midveins and margins, staining or not
. number and position of bracts
. inflorescence strongly coiled toward tip or not
. petal diameter*
. calyx length, hair color, base fleshy, lobe shape, lobes bent or straight [generally upward], lobe midvein stout or slender
. pedicel length, thick & hollow or slender and solid

(*) I'm having trouble understanding what Jepson means by "corolla limb diameter".  For fused petals, the limb is the petal tip beyond the edge of the tube/throat (usually just called a "petal").  For free petals, the limb is the blade beyond the claw.  Presumabely by "corolla limb diameter" Jepson doesn't mean the diameter of all the limbs together since that would just be "corolla diameter".  Therefore, I believe that <b>"limb diameter" means the diameter of the roundish, spreading portion of an individual petal beyond the corolla throat.</b>
