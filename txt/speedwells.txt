{+bird's-eye speedwell}
<p/>
This is the only speedwell I've found.  Its lower petal is generally smaller, and the white spot bleeds strongly onto it and somewhat onto the two adjacent petals.  The upper petal may have a purple margin between the white eye and the blue primary color.

This can also be found throughout the bay area.  It also has a centra white spot, but the spot is more restricted to the inner bowl of the corolla.

There are a few other, rarer speedwells.  Most are different colors and are thus not easily confused with the more common ones.
