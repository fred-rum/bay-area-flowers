{sci:Delphinium}
In most species each flower consists of five petal-like sepals which
grow together to form a hollow pocket with a spur/claw at the end.
Within the sepals are four true petals, small, inconspicuous, and
commonly colored similarly to the sepals.  The long spur of the upper
sepal encloses the nectar-containing spurs of the two upper petals.

Key features:
{-
number of flowers and whether the oldest (lowest) open-flowered pedicels are > 25 mm and > 2 &times; youngest
color of sepals, reflexed or not (especially lower sepals)
multiple stems or just one
stem length, hairy or +- glabrous and ridged or not (especially at base)
length of lower petal blades, and width of petal lobes
proximal petiole (leaf stem) hairs > 0.5 mm & straight, spreading, white, or [maybe] not
leaf hairy adaxially or not, abaxially or not
-}

There may be additional useful features that I haven't pulled from Jepson eFlora.
