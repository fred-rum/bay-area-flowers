ci:Delphinium spp.
x:hist/rare

In most species each flower consists of five petal-like sepals in
which the upper sepal has a long spur at the base.  Within the sepals
are four true petals, smaller and less conspicuous, and usually
colored similarly to the sepals.  The long spur of the upper sepal
encloses the nectar-containing spurs of the two upper petals.  The
lower two petals typically have erect claws which are hidden by the
spreading petal blade.

Key features:
. number of flowers and whether the oldest (lowest) open-flowered pedicels are > 25 mm and > 2 &times; youngest
. color of sepals, reflexed or not (especially lower sepals)
. multiple stems or just one
. stem length, hairy or +- glabrous and ridged or not (especially at base)
. length of lower petal blades, and width of petal lobes
. proximal petiole (leaf stem) hairs > 0.5 mm & straight, spreading, white, or [maybe] not
. leaf hairy adaxially or not, abaxially or not

There may be additional useful features that I haven't pulled from Jepson eFlora.
