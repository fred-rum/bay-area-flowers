Blue-eyed marys have 5 corolla lobes: 2 forming the upper lip, 3 forming the lower lip with the center of those forming a keel beneath enclosing the stamens and style.

This page is not particularly complete because I don't know which so-called key features are actually visible and diagnostic.

(Potential) key features:
{-
whorls dense or loose
proximal (lowest) pedicels > or < calyx
corolla throat as wide as long or longer than wide
upper filaments have a basal spur (1--2 mm) curved into a pouch or the spur is shorter or missing.  Requires taking apart a flower.
corolla length
upper corolla lip short compared to lower lip or +- equal
leaf abaxially (bottom) glabrous or hairy
leaf shape
calyx shape
