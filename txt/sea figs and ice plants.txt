sci:Carpobrotus spp.

Flower diameter is the most obvious key feature.

==chilean sea fig:C. chilensis
color: red purple, pink, yellow
Its flower diameter is 3--5 cm.  It primarily grows on coastal dunes and bluffs.  Jepson says that its petals are rose to magenta, but CalPhotos also shows flowers with yellow petals.  Its center contains very many yellow/cream stamens.

==sea fig:C. edulis
color: yellow, pink
Its flower diameter is 8--10 cm.  It has been planted on dunes and freeway embankments.  (Wikipedia has more about its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpobrotus_edulis#California">use in California</a>.)  Its petals start yellow or white, but fade to pink with age, which matches the color range of the chilean sea fig above.
