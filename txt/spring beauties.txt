sci:Claytonia spp.

There are few spring beauties in the bay area.  For now, this section only describes how to distinguish the ones that look similar to miner's lettuce.  A few rare ones can be easily distinguished as something different, so I'll ignore those until I can get some observations.

Key features:
. shape of basal leaves
. shape of cordate leaf disk (short pointed or no points)

==miner's lettuce:C. perfoliata
. My IDs are uncertain until I can get a good photo of basal leaves.
