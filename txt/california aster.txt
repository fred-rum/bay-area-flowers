Jepson lists only one Corethrogyne species in California.  Various taxonomists have partitioned the California populations into multiple species and variants, but Jepson explicitly rejects that notion.  Calflora lists two species in California, but POWO treats the other species as a synonym of this one, so I will stick with Jepson's idea of just one species.
