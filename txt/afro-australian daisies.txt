{jpgs} This is most likely D. fruticosa or D. ecklonis. The flower heads evidently are identical. Jepson distinguishes them mostly by stem:<ul>
<li>D. ecklonis: stem <= 1 m, erect or ascending, branched distally or throughout</li>
<li>D. fruticosa: stem sometimes >> 1 m, trailing to ascending, sparingly branched, rooting at ground contact</li>
</ul>
Jepson further notes:
"Many cultivated forms are hybrids [between the two species] and combine species features; these may escape or persist from cultivation."
