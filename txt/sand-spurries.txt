{sci:Spergularia}
There are other sand spurries in the bay area, but I'm hesitant to include them when the differences are so inconspicuous.

{+red sand spurrey}
{-
annual, delicate
lower main stem 0.3--0.5 mm diam.
2--4+ leaves per axillary cluster
-}

{+sticky sand-spurrey}
{-
strongly perennial herb, stout
lower main stem 0.8--3 mm diam.
0--2+ leaves per axillary cluster
variants can be distinguished by flower color and style length (measure precisely!)
-}
