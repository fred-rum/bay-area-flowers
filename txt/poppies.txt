The diamond-petaled california poppy ({Eschscholzia rhombipetala}) also has no more than an indistinct disc below the corolla.  Its recepticle looks comparatively bloated, as it is wide at the top before slanting down to the width of the stem.  This poppy can be found east of Mt. Diablo, but is unknown in the rest of the bay area.

No other poppies are known to grow wild in the bay area in modern times.
