<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Key features:
. Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
. Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.

==bluewitch nightshade:S. umbelliferum

Flower key features:
. corolla diameter [Jepson's sizes are a bit low; they are corrected here]

Jepson lists some inflorescences as being raceme-like and others as
umbel-like, but they all look the same to me.

Some features are variable within a species, but if a <b>bold feature</b> is seen, it is diagnostic.
