<h2>Solanum spp.</h2>

<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Distinguishing features:
<ul>
<li>Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but does show them matted rather than straight.</li>
<li>Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.</li>
</ul>
