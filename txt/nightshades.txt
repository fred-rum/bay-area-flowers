<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Key features:
{-
Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.
