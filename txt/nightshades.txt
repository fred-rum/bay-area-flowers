<h3>Purple nightshades</h3>

Key features:
. Hairs are branched or 0/simple on upper stem (not flower pedicel).  The hairs are so tiny that maximum camera close-up doesn't always show them branching, but it does show them matted rather than straight.
. Leaf shape.  There is some overlap, but the shapes are often distinct.

==bluewitch nightshade:S. umbelliferum
. upper stem hairs generally dense, branched
. leaf 1--4 cm, ovate, obovate, or elliptic, generally entire

==purple nightshade:S. xanti
. stem +-hairy, hairs are unbranched, glandular or not
. leaf 2--7 cm, lanceolate to ovate, +-entire to 1--2-lobed at base; base obtuse to +-cordate

==new zealand nightshade:S. aviculare

Fruit key features:
. glossy or dull
. sepals reflexed or not

Flower key features:

. leaf toothed or not
. hairs gladular or not

Jepson lists some inflorescences as being raceme-like and others as
umbel-like, but they all look the same to me.

Some features are variable within a species, but if a <b>bold feature</b> is seen, it is diagnostic.

==black nightshade:S. nigrum
. corolla: 10--17 mm diameter [corrected], white
. leaf: 4--7 cm, entire to coarsely wavy-toothed
. hairs: +-spreading or curved, <b>glandular</b> and not
