sci:Trifolium spp.
x:!hist

There are generally 5 sepals, generally fused.  There are also generally 5 petals, which may be free, fused, or only the lower 2 +- fused into a keel.

There are very many clover species in the bay area.  This page lists some key features, but I don't attempt to replicate the whole Jepson decision tree.  Instead, each flower description includes only enough information to (hopefully) confirm an ID hypothesis.

Camera angles:
. top/side of inflorescence with scale
. bottom of inflorescence with scale
. leaflets with scale (not the reduced leaflets directly below the inflorescence)
. peduncle with scale

Key features:
. bracts shape (especially if fused) under inflorescence
. calyx lobes plumose or not
. corolla color
. lengths of bracts, sepals (calyx), petals (corolla), leaflets, leaf stipules, peduncle, and consider pulling off a corolla for the pedicel length
. leaflets palmate or pinnate
. leaflet shape
. various parts hairy or glabrous
