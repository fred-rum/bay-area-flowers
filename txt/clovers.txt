There are very many clover species in the bay area.  This page lists some key distinguishing features, but I don't attempt to replicate the whole Jepson decision tree.  Instead, each flower description includes only enough information to (hopefully) confirm an ID hypothesis.

Camera angles:
{-
top/side of inflorescence with scale
bottom of inflorescence with scale
leaflets with scale (not the reduced leaflets directly below the inflorescence)
peduncle with scale
-}

Distinguishing features:
{-
bracts shape (especially if fused) under inflorescence
calyx lobes plumose or not
corolla color
lengths of bracts, sepals (calyx), petals (corolla), leaflets, leaf stipules, peduncle, and consider pulling off a corolla for the pedicel length
leaflets palmate or pinnate
leaflet shape
various parts hairy or glabrous
