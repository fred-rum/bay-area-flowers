sci:Dichelostemma spp.
x:rare

Key features:
. staminode color, leaning in or out
. perianth tube narrowed above ovary or not

The defining difference is the number of stamens, but I can't count them without taking apart the flower.
There is supposed to be a difference in bracts color, but I can't consistently see it on CalPhotos.
