<h2>Dichelostemma spp.</h2>

Distinguishing features:

<a href="http://www.virtualherbarium.org/glossary/glossary.php?searchfor=crown&searchin=def&B1=Search">crown</a> color, leaning in or out
perianth tube narrowed above ovary or not

The defining difference is the number of stamens, but I can't count them without taking apart the flower.
There is supposed to be a difference in bracts color, but I can't consistently see it on CalPhotos.
