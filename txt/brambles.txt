sci:Rubus spp.

Key features:
. Prickle presence and shape.
. Round or 5-angled stem (pentagonal in cross section).
. Fruit type and color.

Although the leaves have general difference, there is enough variety within a species to make them difficult to use as diagnostic tools.  In addition, some of the characteristics described by Jepson cannot be seen in CalPhotos.
