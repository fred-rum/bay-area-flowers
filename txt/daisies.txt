Many genuses look like daisies.  Here are the most daisy-like ones I've found in the bay area.  A "daisy" plant is generally low growing, and the flower head consists of disk flowers (typically yellow) surrounded by ray flowers (typically white).

Possible key features:
{-
stem erect, decumbent, or prostrate (not to be confused with the peduncle), branching or not
shape and scale of leaves
scale of flower parts
shape and scale of involucre, phyllaries
hair anywhere? (e.g. stem base, upper stem, leaf top or bottom, phyllaries)
-}

{+common daisy}
{-
1--several stems from base, decumbent or prostrate
<b>wide phyllaries</b>
disk flowers: yellow
ray flowers: <b>7--10 mm</b>, narrow, white to pink or purple
-}

{+oxeye daisy}
{-
stem erect, simple or distally branched
<b>involucre flattened hemispheric</b>
disk flowers: yellow
ray flowers: 13--34+; <b>12--30 mm</b>
-}

{+shasta daisy}
{-
stem erect, simple or distally branched
<b>involucre flattened hemispheric</b>
disk flowers: yellow
ray flowers: 13--34+; <b>12--30 mm</b>
[This and L. vulgare above are the only species of this genus in the bay area.]

{+stinking chamomile}
{-
stem generally erect
<b>leaf 1--3-pinnately divided into thread-like lobes</b>
disk flowers: generally yellow
ray flowers: 10--15, apparently ~5 mm, white
-}

{+fleabanes and horseweeds}
{-
stem generally erect
<b>involucre urn- to bell-shaped or generally hemispheric</b>
disk flowers: many, generally yellow
ray flowers: 0--many, 0--15 mm, generally white to pink or purple
-}

{+afro-australian daisies}
{-
stem depends greatly on the species; see sub-key
disk flowers: <b>blue-purple</b>
ray flowers: 25--35 mm, adaxially white and abaxially blue-purple, sometimes deep violet at base or adaxially pink-purple to rose-purple and abaxially purple or deep rose-purple
-}

{+pacific aster}
{-
stem generally erect, 4--10 dm, hairy distally
disk flowers: 4--60+, generally yellow; <b>anthers are highly exserted, giving the disk head a ragged appearance</b>
ray flowers: 15--40, 8--12 mm, pale violet
-}

{+california aster}
{-
1--many stems from base, decumbent to ascending or erect, simple or distally branched
disk flowers: 12--120+, 4--8 mm, yellow; <b>erect flowers stand clearly proud of the rays, are equal length throughout the disk</b>
ray flowers: 10--43, white or pink to purple, <b>conspicuously striate</b>
