Many genuses look like daisies.  Here are the most daisy-like ones I've found in the bay area.

{+common daisy}

cauline leaf alternate, petioled or sessile, blade 50--120+ mm, 8--22+ mm wide, oblanceolate to lanceolate or linear, mid-stem leaves generally proximally entire, distally regularly serrate, glabrous or sparsely hairy
Inflorescence: heads generally radiate (discoid), 1 or in 2--3s
involucre hemispheric or broader, 18--28+ mm diam; phyllaries 35--60+ in 3--4+ series, free, +- ovate to oblanceolate, unequal, glabrous or sparsely hairy, margins scarious, colorless to +- brown, larger phyllaries 2--3 mm wide
receptacle convex, epaleate, glabrous
Ray Flower: 21--34+; corolla white, drying +- pink, ray linear to ovate, 20--30(40+) mm
Disk Flower: 120--200+; corolla yellow, tube +- cylindric, throat bell-shaped, lobes deltate
Ecology: Uncommon. Disturbed areas, forest, streambanks

{+seaside daisy}
{-
Habit: subshrub, 5--30 cm
Stem: +- decumbent, generally branched near mid-stem, glabrous or glandular to densely spreading-hairy
Leaf: alternate, generally sessile, thick, +- fleshy, 2--13 cm, spoon-shaped to widely obovate, entire or distally shallowly toothed; proximal wing-petioled, cauline reduced or not, sometimes +- clasping, spreading-hairy, minutely glandular
Inflorescence: heads generally radiate (discoid, disciform), 1--15, peduncled; inflorescence generally +- flat-topped (raceme- to panicle-like)
involucre urn- to bell-shaped or generally hemispheric, 7--15 mm, 15--35 mm diam
phyllaries linear to narrowly lanceolate, in 2--several series, +- equal to strongly graduated, +- densely long-soft-hairy, minutely glandular, generally ascending or erect in flower, generally green, spreading when pressed, reflexed when dry
receptacle flat to steeply conic, smooth to shallowly pitted
Disk Flower: generally many; corolla generally narrowly funnel-shaped, yellow
Ray Flower: 80--300+; ray 8--15 mm, generally narrow, white to pink or purple
Ecology: Coastal bluffs, dunes, beaches
-}

{+afro-australian daisies}
{-
Habit: Subshrub, +- puberulent and minutely stalked-glandular
Stem: depends greatly on the species; see linked sub-page
Leaf: 3--8 cm, slightly fleshy; proximal wing-petioled, distal +- sessile; blade linear-oblong to obovate, entire or sparingly dentate
Inflorescence: heads 1 or in leafy cyme-like clusters (D. ecklonis only), 4--7 cm diam; involucre +- bell-shaped; phyllaries 12--15 mm, lance-linear, acuminate, narrowly scarious-margined
Disk Flower: corolla 5--6 mm, blue-purple
Ray Flower: ray 2.5--3.5 cm, adaxially white and abaxially blue-purple, sometimes deep violet at base or adaxially pink-purple to rose-purple and abaxially purple or deep rose-purple
Ecology: Uncommon. Disturbed places, beaches, coastal areas (D. fruiticosa) orescape from cultivation (D. ecklonis)
