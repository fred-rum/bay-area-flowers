Many genuses look like daisies.  Here are the most daisy-like ones I've found in the bay area.

Possible key features:
{-
stem erect, decumbent, or prostrate
shape and scale of leaves
scale of flower parts
shape and scale of phyllaries
hair anywhere? (e.g. stem base, upper stem, leaf top or bottom, phyllaries)
-}
