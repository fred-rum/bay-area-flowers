I've done the best with this key that I have the patience for, but it still depends on "annual" vs. "perennial" for herbs.

Key features:
. herb vs. shrub (or subshrub)
. flowers [involucres?] are clustered or individual
. flowers grow only at branch tips or also at forks
. perianth lobes alike, or inner narrower than outer
. involucres any combination of glandular, ribbed, sessile, appressed or not
. cauline leaves clustered or not
. basal and cauline leaf shapes
