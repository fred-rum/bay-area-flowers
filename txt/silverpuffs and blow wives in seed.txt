Blow wives and silverpuffs form a ball of seeds.  Each seed (fruit) has a
parachute of wings to catch the wind.
<ul>
<li>Each wing of blow wives consists only of a flat scale.</li>
<li>Each wing of silverpuffs (Uropappus and Microseris) consists of a flat scale with a hair-like bristle extending past the scale tip.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uropappus</h3>

There is only one species of Uropappus.

{+Uropappus lindleyi}
<ul>
<li>Seeds are very dark or black.</li>
<li>Each scale is notched once at the tip where the bristle emerges.</li>
<li>The bristle is shorter than the scale.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Microseris</h3>

Microseris has lighter colored seeds and the scale tips are either
ragged or entire (not notched once).
