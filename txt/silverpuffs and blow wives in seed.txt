Distinguishing features:
{-
presence of bristles
length of all features
number of scales per seed
seed color (and sometimes shape)
scale color and tip shape (and sometimes fuzziness)
bristle fuzziness
-}

Blow wives and silverpuffs form a ball of seeds.  Each seed (fruit) has a
parachute of wings to catch the wind.
{-
Each wing of blow wives consists only of a flat scale.
Each wing of silverpuffs (Uropappus and Microseris) consists of a flat scale with a hair-like bristle extending past the scale tip.

<h3>Uropappus</h3>

There is only one species of Uropappus.

{+Uropappus lindleyi}
{-
Seeds are very dark or black.
Each scale is notched once at the tip where the bristle emerges.
The bristle is shorter than the scale.
-}

<h3>Microseris</h3>

Microseris has lighter colored seeds and the scale tips are either
ragged or entire (not notched once).
