Key features:
. bark color
. acorn cup scales thin or thick
. nut shell hairy, woolly, or not inside
. leaf shape, colors on top and bottom

CalFlora lists many pines in the bay area, but for now I will confine
this list to the less rare ones (> 50 CalFlora records).

"Acorn cup scales thin" means that the cap conforms closely to the
shape of the underlying nut, rather than being distinctly puffed out.

"Adaxially convex" means that the leaf is correspondingly abaxially concave.

Be careful when checking the leaf shape because the tip is considered
separately.  E.g. a leaf that is "roundish" may actually be lanceolate.
