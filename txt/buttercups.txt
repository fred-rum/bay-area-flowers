sci:Ranunculus spp.

There are quite a few buttercups in the bay area, but I've only bothered to look up ID info for those that look like california buttercup.

==california buttercup:R. californicus
. stems erect to ascending or decumbent (prostrate), generally not rooting at nodes
. <b>9--17 petals</b>
. very common

Jepson distinguishes these only by details of fruit shape.  I'll have to look for other key features if I find any erect/ascending buttercups with 5--7 petals.

==rough-fruited buttercup:R. muricatus
. stem erect to decumbent
. 5 petals
. common

==R. canus
. stem erect to decumbent
. 5--7 petals
. Mission Peak, Sunol, Mt. Diablo

==R. occidentalis

. 5--6 petals
. Sierra Azul, Del Valle, Mt. Diablo

==R. orthorhynchus
