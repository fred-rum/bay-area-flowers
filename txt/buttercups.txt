There are quite a few buttercups in the bay area, but I've only bothered to look up ID info for those that look like california buttercup.

{+california buttercup}
{-
stems erect to ascending or decumbent (prostrate), generally not rooting at nodes
<b>9--17 petals</b>
very common

Jepson distinguishes these only by details of fruit shape.  I'll have to look for other key features if I find any erect/ascending buttercups with 5--7 petals.
