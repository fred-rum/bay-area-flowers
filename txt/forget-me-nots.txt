sci:Myosotis spp.

Forget-me-nots generally develop in raceme-like cymes, coiled, then +- open in age.  Thus, individuals of the same species can look very different from each other.

Key features:
. corolla size
. leaf length vs. width

==broadleaf forget-me-not:M. latifolia
. corolla 5--10 mm wide, blue (but pink when young), prominent yellow ring in center.
. inflorescence alternating below; flowers denser at the tip, possibly resembling a fiddleneck-like spiral.
. leaves roughly 2--3x wider than corollas, roughly 2--3x longer than wide.

==changing forget-me-not:M. discolor
. smaller corolla, often with different colors for each flower.
. fiddleneck-like inflorescence.
. Santa Cruz range.

The forget-me-nots above are the only ones that Jepson thinks grow in
the bay area.  However, CalFlora has a few others observed here:

==bay forget-me-not:M. laxa
. smaller corolla, but the inflorescence otherwise looks much like broadleaf forget-me-not.
. small, narrow leaves.

==wood forget-me-not:M. sylvatica
<p/>
Appears in Calflora, but Jepson says that <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_cpn.pl?34218">all identifications in California are mistaken</a>.
