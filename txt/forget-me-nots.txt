<h2>Myosotis spp.</h2>

{broadleaf forget-me-not-1.jpg} {child:broadleaf forget-me-not}
<ul>
<li>corolla 5&ndash;10 mm wide, blue (but pink when young), prominent yellow ring in center.</li>
<li>inflorescence alternating below; flowers denser at the tip, possibly resembling a fiddleneck-like spiral.</li>
<li>leaves roughly 2&ndash;3x wider than corollas, roughly 2&ndash;3x longer than wide.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>smaller corolla, often with different colors for each flower.</li>
<li>fiddleneck-like inflorescence.</li>
<li>Santa Cruz range.</li>
</ul>

The forget-me-nots above are the only ones that Jepson thinks grow in
the bay area.  However, CalFlora has a few others observed here:

{https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0208+1294} bay forget-me-not ({Myosotis laxa})
<ul>
<li>smaller corolla, but the inflorescence otherwise looks much like broadleaf forget-me-not.</li>
<li>small, narrow leaves.</li>
</ul>

{https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0311+1015} wood forget-me-not ({Myosotis sylvatica})
<p/>
Appears in Calflora, but Jepson says that <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_cpn.pl?34218">all identifications in California are mistaken</a>.
