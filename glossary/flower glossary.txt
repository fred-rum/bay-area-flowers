<h2>Parts of a flower</h2>

figure:hypanthium
figure:receptacle
figure:flower

<p>The major parts of a flower are the pedicel, perianth, stamens, and pistils.  Any of these parts may be missing or vanishingly small for a particular species or individual flower.</p>

{pedicel,pedicels,pediceled} The stalk of an individual flower.  Compare to peduncle. [figure:hypanthium]
{receptacle,receptacles} The distal end of the pedicel (or sometimes the peduncle), where the flower parts (or head) are attached.  See hypanthium. [figure:receptacle]
{perianth,perianths} The collective term for the calyx and corolla (with the calyx subtending the corolla).  The term is usually used where the calyx and corolla are difficult to distinguish (except by position). [figure:hypanthium]
{perianth part,perianth parts} A sepal or petal.  The term is usually used where sepals and petals are difficult to distinguish. [figure:staminode]
{tepal,tepals} A perianth part, especially where the perianth parts are +- entirely free.
{hypanthium,hypanthia,hypanthiums} The structure formed by the fused lower portions of the perianth. [figure:hypanthium]

<h3>Calyx</h3>

figure:calyx.svg

{calyx,calyces,calyxes} The collective term for all sepals of a flower.  Protects the flower in bud.  Usually green, but may match the color of the corolla or have some other color. [figure:calyx]
{sepal,sepals} A free or fused member of the calyx.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a calyx lobe rather than a sepal as a whole. [figure:flower]

<h3>Corolla</h3>

figure:corolla.svg

{corolla,corollas} The collective term for all petals of a flower.  Surrounds the flowers sexual parts.  Usually bright colored. [figure:corolla]
{petal,petals} A free or fused member of the corolla.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a free corolla lobe rather than a petal as a whole. [figure:flower]

<h3>Pistil</h3>

figure:ovary

{pistil,pistils} A pollen-accepting ("female") sexual part of a flower, each composed of an ovary, style, and stigma. [figure:ovary]
{ovary,ovaries} The usually wider base of the pistil that forms the seed or fruit when germinated.  The hypanthium (perianth and stamens) may be attached to the top, the bottom, or somewhere along the sides of the ovary. [figure:ovary]
{style,styles} The tube that carries pollen from the stigma to the ovary. [figure:ovary]
{stigma,stigmas} The distal end of the pistil that captures pollen for germination.  May be lobed. [figure:ovary]

<h3>Stamen</h3>

{stamen,stamens} A pollen-producing ("male") sexual part of a flower, each composed of a filament and an anther. [figure:flower]
{filament,filaments} The stalk that holds up an anther.
{anther,anthers} The distal end of the stamen where pollen is produced.  Usually has two lobes.
{staminode,staminodes} A sterile stamen with a modified appearance. [figure:staminode]

<h2>Parts of an inflorescence</h2>

{inflorescence,inflorescences} A cluster of flowers from a common point or sharing a stalk that has only flowers on it.
{bract,bracts,bracted} Small leaf-like structures (or analogue) at the base of an inflorescence.  May be fused together or not.
{epicalyx,epicalyces,epicalyxes} A whorl of bracts forming an extra calyx-like structure.
{peduncle,peduncles} The stalk of an inflorescence (or of a head in the sunflower family) or of an individual flower that is not part of an inflorescence.  See also pedicel.
{scape,scapes} A peduncle, particularly one that arises directly from ground level with no cauline leaves.


<h2>Other flower terms</h2>

{cleistogamous} Self-pollinating without opening.  Generally looks bud-like.
{dioecious} A plant that has only either male or female flowers on it, never both on the same plant.
{involucel,involucels} Secondary involucre within an inflorescence.
{involucre,involucres} Collective term for a cluster of bracts.
{panicle,panicles,panicled} Branched infloresence with flowers that grow from the proximal end.
{salverform} With a slender tube and abruptly spreading limbs (e.g. "T" shaped).
{spike,spikes,spiked} Inflorescence with all flowers sessile on the main axis, generally flowering from the proximal end.  See panicle.
{umbel,umbels} An inflorescence in which 3+ flower pedicels branch from a common point.
