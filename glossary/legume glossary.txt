<h2>Parts of a pea flower (any flower in the legume family)</h2>

A pea flower has five petals in a bilateral arrangement (not radial).

{banner,banners} The topmost petal.  It may have a crease down the middle that makes it looks like two petals stuck together.

{wing,wings} The two lateral petals below the banner, often fused at their top edge and enfolding the keel.

{keel,keels} The two bottom petals, often fused at their bottom edge.  May be partially or fully hidden by the wings.
