<h2>Parts of a leaf</h2>

{leaf,leaves,leaved} The major parts of a leaf are the blade, petiole, and stipule.  The petiole and stipule may each be present or not, while the blade may be very small or needle-like.

{blade,blades} The expanded portion of a leaf where photosynthesis primarily occurs.  May be simple or compound with multiple leaflets.
{petiole,petioles} The stalk of a leaf.
{stipule,stipules} Extension at the base of the petiole. [figure:narrow-leaved clover]

{leaflet,leaflets} A division of a compound leaf (which may itself be further compound).  Can be distinguished from a leaf by the lack of any structures in its axil other than more leaflets or occasionally stipules.

<h2>Hair</h2>

{bristle,bristles,bristly} A stiff, straight hair.
{canescent} Densely covered with fine silvery white hairs.
{ciliate,cilia,cilium} With generally straight hair along its margins.
{glabrous} Without hair.
{puberulent} Covered in very short, soft hairs.
{strigose} Having stiff, straight, appressed hairs.
{tomentose} Covered with matted, felt-like hairs.

<h2>Armament</h2>

<p>All of these terms may occasionally be used loosely rather than following the strict definition.  Many examples are given in this <a href="https://opuntiads.com/oblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Thorns-Spines-and-Prickles.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

{prickle,prickles,prickled} Sharp-pointed projection not arising from a node.  Often stiff.
{spine,spines,spined} Sharp-pointed projection derived from a leaf, leaf part, or stipule.  Usually stiff.
{thorn,thorns,thorned} Sharp-pointed projection derived from a stem.  Usually stiff.

<h2>2-D shapes (e.g. for a leaf)</h2>

<p>Particularly for leaves, the base of the blade may taper to the petiole regardless of the shape description. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Examples-of-leaf-shapes_fig1_295685020">[example leaf shapes]</a></p>
