<h2>Parts of a flower</h2>

<p>The major parts of a flower are the pedicel, perianth, stamens, and pistils.  Any of these parts may be missing or vanishingly small for a particular species or individual flower.</p>

{pedicel,pedicels,pediceled} The stalk of an individual flower.  See also peduncle.
{perianth,perianths} The collective term for the calyx and corolla.  The term is usually used where they are difficult to distinguish except by position.
{perianth part,perianth parts} A sepal or petal.  The term is usually used where they are difficult to distinguish.
{tepal,tepals} A perianth part, especially where the perianth parts are +- entirely free.
{hypanthium,hypanthia,hypanthiums} The structure formed by the fused lower portions of the perianth.

<h3>Calyx</h3>

{calyx,calyces,calyxes} The collective term for all sepals of a flower.  Protects the flower in bud.  Usually green, but may be brightly colored, including matching the color of the corolla.
{sepal,sepals} A free or fused member of the calyx.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a calyx lobe rather than a sepal as a whole.

<h3>Corolla</h3>

{corolla,corollas} The collective term for all petals of a flower.  Surrounds the flowers sexual parts.  Usually bright colored.
{petal,petals} A free or fused member of the corolla.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a free corolla lobe rather than a petal as a whole.

<h3>Pistil</h3>

{pistil,pistils} A pollen-accepting ("female") sexual part of a flower, each composed of an ovary, style, and stigma.
{ovary,ovaries} The usually wider base of the pistil that forms the seed or fruit when germinated.  The perianth and stamens may be attached to the top, the bottom, or somewhere along the sides of the ovary.
{style,styles} The tube that carries pollen from the stigma to the ovary.
{stigma,stigmas} The distal end of the pistil that captures pollen for germination.  May be lobed.

<h3>Stamen</h3>

{stamen,stamens} A pollen-producing ("male") sexual part of a flower, each composed of a filament and an anther.
{filament,filaments} The stalk that holds up an anther.
{anther,anthers} The distal end of the stamen where pollen is produced.  Usually has two lobes.

<h2>3-D shapes (e.g. for the involucre)</h2>

<p>All involucre shapes may be flared at the tip or not.</p>

{bell-shaped,bell} Rapidly widening at the base, then slowly expanding toward the tip.
{cylindric} Significantly longer than wide with parallel sides.
{rotate} Saucer-shaped.  For a corolla, generally means a fused base with little or no tube and spreading limbs.
{urn-shaped,urn} Rapidly widening at the base, then narrowed toward the tip.
