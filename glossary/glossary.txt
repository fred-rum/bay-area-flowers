{divide,divides,dividing,divided} Divided into distinct parts, e.g. a compound leaf.
{entire} In one smooth shape; i.e. not toothed, lobed, or compound.

{exsert,exserting,exserted} Protruding more than surrounding structures.
{free,freed} Growing separately from equivalent structures at the same level, e.g. sepals in the calyx.  Compare fused.
{fuse,fused} Equivalent structures at the same level that have grown together (more than just touching).  Compare free.
{glabrous} Without hair.
{glaucous} Covered with the appearance of a whitish powder.
{herb,herbs,herbaceous} Plant without any woody parts.
{lanceolate} Long and somewhat narrow; widest between the middle and the base.
{leaflet,leaflets} A division of a compound leaf (which may itself be further compound).
{lobe,lobes,lobed} An protrusion from a larger body, otherwise undifferentiated from the main body.  E.g. a corolla lobe is the free part of a petal.
{mucro,mucros} An abrupt, short, narrow tip/projection.
{nodding} Partially drooping, between pendent and spreading.
{obovate} Egg shaped; widest between the middle and the tip.

{palmate,palmately} With lobes spreading from a common point.
{palmate-pinnate} 1st-order palmate and 2nd-order pinnate.
{papillate,papillated} Has a surface with small protuberances, e.g. like the surface of your tongue.
{pendent} Drooping or hanging +- straight down.
{perennial,perennials} Lives for more than two years.  Maybe be woody or non-woody.
{perennial herb,perennial herbss} Non-woody plant that lives for more than two years.
{petiole,petioles} The stalk of a leaf.
{pinnate,pinnately} Refers to a two-dimensional branched structure.  Typically refers to lobes or leaflets in a leaf.  1-pinnate means that the structure has 1 level of branches arising from a central axis.  2-pinnate means that the branches also have branches, etc.
{primary leaf,primary leaves} The first one or two leaves of a sprouting monocot or dicot.  These are the most proximal leaves.  For dicots, the two leaves are opposite.
{proximal,proximally} Growing closer to the base and farther from the tip of a structure.  The structure is often implied; e.g. a proximal leaf grows close to the base of the whole plant.  Contrast distal.
{recurved,recurve,recurving} Gradually curved backward.  Contrast reflexed.
{reflexed,reflex,reflexing} Abruptly bent somewhat or entirely backward.  Opposite of erect or ascending.  Contrast recurved.
{reniform} Like cordate, but distally rounded instead of pointed, and typically less acute at the base.
{sagittate} Shaped like an arrowhead, with basal lobes near parallel to the axis.
{salverform} With a slender tube and abruptly spreading limbs (e.g. "T" shaped).
{scarious} Membranous.
{segment,segments} The smallest division of a compound/dissected leaf.
{serrate,serrated} With teeth pointing tipward.  Contrast dentate.

{subtend,subtending,subtended} Growing immediately proximal to the compared structure.
{taproot} Primary root growing straight down, tapering at the end, with smaller lateral branches.
{terminal} The segment at the end, e.g. the most distal segment of a compound or lobed leaf.
{tooth,teeth,toothed} A small, roughly triangular projection.  See serrate and dentate.  Compare lobe.
{truncate,truncating,truncated} Ending (or beginning) abruptly, e.g. with no tapering.
{twig,twigs} The ultimate branch segment of a woody plant.
{ultimate} The smallest division of a compound/dissected leaf or the final segments of a branching stem.
