<h2>Parts of a flower</h2>

<p>The major parts of a flower are the pedicel, perianth, stamens, and pistils.  Any of these parts may be missing or vanishingly small for a particular species or individual flower.</p>

{pedicel,pedicels,pediceled} The stalk of an individual flower.  See also peduncle.
{perianth,perianths} The collective term for the calyx and corolla.  The term is usually used where they are difficult to distinguish except by position.
{perianth part,perianth parts} A sepal or petal.  The term is usually used where they are difficult to distinguish.
{hypanthium,hypanthia,hypanthiums} The structure formed by the fused lower portions of the perianth.

<h3>Calyx</h3>

{calyx,calyces,calyxes} The collective term for all sepals of a flower.  Protects the flower in bud.  Usually green, but may be brightly colored, including matching the color of the corolla.
{sepal,sepals} A free or fused member of the calyx.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a calyx lobe rather than a sepal as a whole.

<h3>Corolla</h3>

{corolla,corollas} The collective term for all petals of a flower.  Surrounds the flowers sexual parts.  Usually bright colored.
{petal,petals} A free or fused member of the corolla.  If partially fused, reference is usually made to a free corolla lobe rather than a petal as a whole.

<h3>Pistil</h3>

{pistil,pistils} A pollen-accepting ("female") sexual part of a flower, each composed of an ovary, style, and stigma.
{ovary,ovaries} The usually wider base of the pistil that forms the seed or fruit when germinated.
{style,styles} The tube that carries pollen from the stigma to the ovary.
{stigma,stigmas} The distal end of the pistil that captures pollen for germination.  May be lobed.

<h3>Stamen</h3>

{stamen,stamens} A pollen-producing ("male") sexual part of a flower, each composed of a filament and an anther.
{filament,filaments} The stalk that holds up an anther.
{anther,anthers} The distal end of the stamen where pollen is produced.  Usually has two lobes.

{ligule,ligules} The petal of a flower in the sunflower family comprised only of ray-like flowers (i.e. not disk and ray).
{phyllary,phyllaries} A bract of the flower head in the sunflower family.  A member of the involucre.
