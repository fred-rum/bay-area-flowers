{abaxial,abaxially} The surface further from the stem when upright.  E.g. the lower surface of a leaf or the outer surface of a petal.
{adaxial,adaxially} The surface closer to the stem when upright.  E.g. the upper surface of a leaf or the inner surface of a petal.
{annual,annuals} Lives for one year or less, generally without forming any woody parts.
{basal} Positioned at the base.  Most commonly refers to leaves growing at the base of the stem.  Contrast cauline.
{calyx,calyces,calyxes} Collective term for sepals.
{cauline} Growing along a plant's stem.  Most commonly refers to leaves.  Contrast basal.
{compound} Generally, composed of multiple parts.  Opposite of simple.<ul><li>Leaf: divided into distinct leaflets connected by an axis but no blade material.</li><li>Umbel: an umbel of umbels</li></ul>
{corolla,corollas} Collective term for petals.
{crenate,crenately,scalloped} With shallow, rounded teeth and usually with acute sinuses.  Could also be called "scalloped".
{cylindric} Significantly longer than wide with parallel sides.
{decurrent} The leaf blade extends onto the stem as a short wing.
{dioecious} A plant that has only either male or female flowers on it, never both on the same plant.
{distal,distally} Growing farther away from the base and closer to the tip of a structure.  The structure is often implied; e.g. a proximal leaf grows close to the base of the whole plant.  Contrast proximal.
{glabrous} Without hair.
{glaucous} Covered with the appearance of a whitish powder.
{herb,herbs} Plant without any woody parts.
{inflorescence,inflorescences} A cluster of flowers from a common point or sharing a stalk that has only flowers on it.  A head in the sunflower family.
{involucre,involucres} Collective term for a cluster of bracts.  Typically refers to the green base of a flower head in the sunflower family.
{bract,bracts} Small leaf-like structures (or analogue) at the base of an inflorescence.  May be fused together or not.
{palmate,palmately} With lobes spreading from a common point.
{palmate-pinnate} 1st-order palmate and 2nd-order pinnate.
{pedicel,pedicels} The stalk of an individual flower.
{peduncle,peduncles} The stalk of an inflorescence (or of a head in the sunflower family) or of an individual flower that is not part of an inflorescence.
{perianth,perianths} The collective term for the calyx and corolla.
{petal,petals} A free or fused member of the corolla.
{petiole,petioles} The stalk of a leaf.
{pinna,pinnae} The 1st-order division of a frond blade.
{pinnate,pinnately} Refers to a two-dimensional branched structure.  Typically refers to lobes or leaflets in a leaf.  1-pinnate means that the structure has 1 level of branches arising from a central axis.  2-pinnate means that the branches also have branches, etc.
{pinnule,pinnules} The 2nd-order division of a frond blade.  (The 1st-order division of a pinna.)
{proximal,proximally} Growing closer to the base and farther from the tip of a structure.  The structure is often implied; e.g. a proximal leaf grows close to the base of the whole plant.  Contrast distal.
{receptacle,receptacles} The end of the pedicel (or sometimes the peduncle), where the flower (or head) is attached.
{sagittate} Shaped like an arrowhead, with basal lobes near parallel to the axis.
{sepal,sepals} A free or fused member of the calyx.  Usually green, or often the same color as the petals, or sometimes different.
{shrub,shrubs} Woody plant, shorter than a tree, generally with many branches from the base.
{simple} Generally, composed of a single part; undivided; unbranched.  Opposite of compound.<ul><li>Leaf: composed of a single part (which may be lobed or dissected), not divided into distinct leaflets separated from each other.</li></ul>
{stellate,stellately} With 3+ branches radiating from a common point.  (Usually used to describe hair.)
{stipe,stipes} In the knotweed family, a distal extension of the pedicel separated by a line, bulge, or difference in thickness.  In ferns, the frond stalk; equivalent to petiole.
{stipule,stipules} Extension at the base of the petiole.
{strigose} Having stiff, straight, appressed hairs.
{subshrub,subshrubs} Similar to a shrub, but with the distal stems less woody.
{twig,twigs} Final branch segment.
{waif,waifs} A plant that has spread with human assistance but cannot reproduce or spread further on its own; will eventually die out assuming no further assistance.
