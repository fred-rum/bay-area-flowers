<h1>Chris Nelson&rsquo;s Bay Area Flower Guide</h1>
<a href="html/all.html">All flowers</a>
<p/>
Flowers by color:
<ul>
<li><a href="html/white.html">White</a> (including cream)</li>
<li><a href="html/yellow.html">Yellow</a> (including orange)</li>
<li><a href="html/red.html">Red</a> (including salmon)</li>
<li><a href="html/purple.html">Purple</a> (including blue and pink)</li>
<li><a href="html/other.html">Other colors</a> (e.g. green or indefinite)</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Flowers are categorized only under their primary color.  The flower center is not included if it is different from the surrounding corolla.  White is not included unless the entire flower may be (nearly) white.  If an individual flower can have different primary colors (e.g. depending on age), then it is listed under each of those colors.
<h2>Usage Guide</h2>
The Bay Area Flower Guide (BAFG) is a collection of my own photos and notes.
It is designed to be my own reference as well as something I can point people to when making flower identifications. <b>Warning</b>: I am not a biologist, just an interested amateur.  All flower identifications should be taken as my opinion and not authoritative.
<p/>
The BAFG is not designed to be <b>your</b> reference.  You can use it as a reference if you like, but its quirks might frustrate you.
<p/>
The BAFG covers the San Francisco Bay Area, from the Pacific coast to corners including Mt. Tamalpais, Mt. Diablo, San Luis Reservoir, and Santa Cruz.  Some areas outside those bounds are also covered, particularly Pinnacles National Park.  The gravitational center for my observations is probably somewhere around Cupertino.
<p/>
Only wildflowers are covered, not cultivated flowers.

Primary refences include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.calflora.org/">CalFlora</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/">CalPhotos</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/">Jepson eFlora</a>.  In particular, numbered keys to distinguishing flowers come from eFlora, usually in the key to the particular genus.  New users will want to refer to the <a target="_blank" href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/IJM_glossary.html">eFlora Glossary</a>.  Once you start using eFlora for yourself, you may also want to browse the <a target="_blank" href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/conventions.html">eFlora User's Guide</a>
